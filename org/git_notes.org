* Git notes
=git status=, check current status

When working with a git repository keep this mental model of what happens when you add/commit/etc:
[[file:figures/github-file-stages.svg]]

/Note: to see images inline. Run/ ~M-x org-toggle-inline-images RET~.


** Remove/untrack files from repository
If you accidentally committed & uploaded files you don't want in your
repository, simply deleting them in the local repository and then pushing
updates to remote does not remove the files.

After deleting the files from working directory you need to run =git rm <deleted
file1> <deleted file2>= before pushing changes to remote repository.
