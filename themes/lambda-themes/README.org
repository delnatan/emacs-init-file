* Aims of Theme

Lambda-themes is a collection of four higher and lower contrast light and dark
themes. The color palette is limited, and organized according to function and
salience. Here I largely agree with Nicolas Rougier that [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06030.pdf][attentional constraints]]
matter when thinking about the color palette. Lambda-themes tries to use color
in a way to provide for a reasonable compromise between aesthetics and
readability.

In general the theme aims to use as few highly distinct colors as possible
without crossing over into full "monochrome" territory. It also means that the
themes use various devices other than foreground face color to capture
meaningful differences in text. Different text weights are used throughout, as
are subtle differences in background coloring. Colored headlines are largely
avoided.

Note that I use SF Mono for my font here, and [[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] to colorize
parens. The mode-line/status-line is from [[https://github.com/Lambda-Emacs/lambda-line][lambda-line]]. 

* Installation

Lambda-themes is not yet on MELPA. In the meantime to use this package you'll
have to clone or otherwise download the repo and put it into your load path.
Here's a basic way of setting it up using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lambda-themes
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "lambda-emacs/lambda-themes") 
    :custom
    (lambda-themes-set-italic-comments t)
    (lambda-themes-set-italic-keywords t)
    (lambda-themes-set-variable-pitch t) 
    :config
    ;; load preferred theme 
    (load-theme 'lambda-light))
#+end_src

* Options

See =M-x customize-group lambda-themes= for the full list of options.

- Set evil-cursor colors
- Set italic comments or keywords
- Set use of variable pitch in headlines, etc. 
- Set a custom color palette.


* Acknowledgments

- The colors for this theme have been inspired by [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas Rougier's]] work on
  [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]], but has evolved with some ideas and colors
  borrowed from [[https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation][material colors]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized]] and [[https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-emacs][nord]], as well as color design
  aided by [[https://coolors.co][coolers.co]] and the classic [[https://www.c82.net/werner/][Werner's Nomenclature]]. The faded themes
  are variations on my [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/bespoke-themes][bespoke-themes]] design.
- The function for loading the specific color theme is taken from
  [[https://github.com/humanoid-colors/emacs-humanoid-themes][humanoid-themes]].
